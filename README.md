STATISTICS IN PERCEPTION  Course Description:  The course will cover a variety of statistical techniques used in vision and perception research, including applied linear regression analysis, ANOVA, linear mixed models, Frequentist vs Bayesian inference, power analysis, and type 1 errors. Each of these techniques will be reviewed and implemented using data from research provided by students.

This is where code assignments, powerpoints for lectures, etc will live. The wiki here will act as our own created "Chapter Book"
